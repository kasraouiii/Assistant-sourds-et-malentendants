# About this project
Our goal is to make it easier for individuals who are deaf or have hearing loss to communicate with the people around them: relatives, friends, acquaintances, and strangers.

The Talk mobile app converts speech to text and can also produce spoken audio of written text. It uses Google TTS speech technologies for speech recognition and synthesis. The app also includes a set of ready-to-use phrases, a history of conversations, and a large font feature.

This repository contains the Android Studio project.
